        Welcome to my website! My name is Joshua, I am a data science student eager to pursue roles where I can leverage machine learning 
        and mathematical modeling in real world applications such as the betterment of medical practices. 
        Specifically, I have interests in Computational Neuroscience and Health Informatics.<br>
        <!--note that despite this break the paragraph is still one big block of text on the website-->
        <br> My projects and research experience span from statistical analysis and machine learning to database design.

                        This website! I used HTML for webpage structure, and CSS for styling. This has been an ongoing project that is still in development. 
                        Any critiques or ideas are greatly appreciated.</div>

                    Pneumonia Neural Network
                    <div class="summary">
                        Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow) in python to detect if an x-ray of one’s chest indicates pneumonia; was able to increase model accuracy over time by 10% via ensemble and boosting algorithms.
                        Utilized Scikit-learn and Matplotlib for statistics (loss, recall, etc.) as well as confusion matrix.

                    Hillside Inventory Database
                    <div class="summary">
                        Worked in team of 3 to create market inventory database using SQL and web-based programming.
                        Developed scalable database with real time inventory visibility for students, workers, and suppliers.

                    DReaM Lab Clustering Project
                    <div class="summary">
                        Independently analyzed a dataset on trust in chatbots (CBs), message boards (MBs), and humans concerning personal questions. 
                        Implemented self-led exploratory analysis as well as Machine Learning models to create a Jupyter Notebook with visualizations using Matplotlib and Pandas. 
                        Utilized rand score from K-means Clustering model (Scikit-learn) to compare different 3 and 4 cluster solutions for 200 survey participants; found that rand-scores between 0.8 and 1 showed different clusters put similar amounts of trust in CBs, MBs and humans for questions.

                    Weak Signal Propogation Reporter Regression Analysis
                    <div class="summary">
                        Analyzed dataset on radio signals from calls that were both transmitted and received; EDA performed in R Markdown.
                        Partitioned data (caret) was used to train and test linear regression model; ggplot used for visualization.
                        A means squared and r-squared of 75.01 and 0.11 indicated poor model fit and that SNR variability was not explained well from test data.

                    <div class="summary">
                        Analyzed dataset on tumor cell traits; exploratory data analysis done in Jupyter Notebook.
                        Notebook contained statistical outlier analysis and correlation map to use for logistic regression model.
                        Applied principial component analysis (PCA).
                        Logistic regression model implemented using Scikit-learn achieved 95% accuracy in predicting whether tumor cells are malignant or benign.
